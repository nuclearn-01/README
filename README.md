# README

- 👋 Hi, I'm Assunta Barrows.
- 👀 I'm interested in Bioinformatics, Python Programming, AI/Machine Learning, and exploring the fascinating world of genomic data analysis. I love solving complex biological problems through computational approaches!

- 🌱 I'm currently learning:
  * Advanced Python for biological data processing
  * Genomic data analysis and visualization
  * Machine learning applications in bioinformatics
  * Next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis
  * Bioinformatics algorithms and tools development

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on:
  * Bioinformatics research projects
  * Python-based genomic analysis tools
  * AI/ML applications in biological data
  * Open-source bioinformatics software development

- 📫 How to reach me:
  * GitHub: @nuclearn-01
  * Location: San José State University (San Jose State or SJSU)
  * Major: Bioinformatics

- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: I can turn coffee into code and transform complex biological data into meaningful insights! Also, I believe Python is not just a programming language, but a way of life in bioinformatics! 🐍
